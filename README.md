# Computational Philology
files, notebooks &amp; code related to doing philology with the help of computers

This is a collection of stuff I've produced during the process of developing a research programme of computational philology,
which is the use of computational methods in the aid of building a contextual, comparative understanding of history, culture, 
and of language especially.
